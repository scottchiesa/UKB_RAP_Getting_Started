# Getting Started on the UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform using command line interface

UK Biobank provide a tonne of tutorials, YouTube videos, and forums for using the DNANexus Research Analysis Platform (RAP). If you are not an experienced user, however, it can still be very confusing and difficult to find where to even get started. 

The UKB RAP has two main ways it can be accessed and used, either through the web interface at https://platform.dnanexus.com/login or via command line interface (CLI) from a terminal on the user's local machine. While the former may be easier and more intuitive in the short-term, more advanced analyses are often better carried out using the latter.

This short tutorial has therefore been written to give new users some useful scripts and other useful info that should get them up-and-running on the RAP using a command line interface. 

## Software Needed

**Note that there are countless programmes and methods for using CLI, these are just the ones I currently use**
